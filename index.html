Welcome to my corner of the internet where cybersecurity is both a profession and a passion. As a IT Security Specialist, I've navigated the dance between attacking (Red Team) and defending (Blue Team) in the dynamic world of cybersecurity. My journey has transformed me into a Purple Teamer, synthesizing the best of both worlds to enhance system security and resilience.

With a background in Red Team assessments and a deep dive into Blue Team strategies through Elastic SIEM, I bring a unique perspective to the cybersecurity challenges facing organizations today.
